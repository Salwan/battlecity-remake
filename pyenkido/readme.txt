PyEnkido is an Entity based game engine.
Coupled with PyGame, it provides a good base for any type of 2D game you can come up with, meaning it isn't genre specific.
The game is formed of a group of Scenes.
Each scene has different game components each called Entity.
Entities can be controlled by Controllers, or not controlled... whatever you wish.
There is a very basic GUI system inplace, it's buggy and incomplete, but it may be useful.

Like the game, the engine is released under GPLv3.
